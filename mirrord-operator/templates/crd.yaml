              Defines splittable Kafka topics consumed by some workload living in the same namespace.

              # Concurrent splitting

              Concurrent Kafka splitting sessions are allowed, as long as they use the same topic id or their topics' `nameSources` do not overlap.

              # Example

              ```yaml apiVersion: queues.mirrord.metalbear.co/v1alpha kind: MirrordKafkaTopicsConsumer metadata: name: example namespace: default spec: consumerName: example-deployment consumerApiVersion: apps/v1 consumerKind: Deployment topics: - id: example-topic nameSources: - directEnvVar: container: example-container name: KAFKA_TOPIC_NAME groupIdSources: - directEnvVar: container: example-container name: KAFKA_GROUP_ID clientConfig: example-config ```

              1. Creating the resource below will enable Kafka splitting on a deployment `example-deployment` living in namespace `default`. Id `example-topic` can be then used in the mirrord config to split the topic for the duration of the mirrord session.

              2. Topic name will be resolved based on `example-deployment`'s pod template by extracting value of variable `KAFKA_TOPIC_NAME` defined directly in `example-container`.

              3. Consumer group id used by the mirrord operator will be resolved based on `example-deployment`'s pod template by extracting value of variable `KAFKA_GROUP_ID` defined directly in `example-container`.

              4. For the duration of the session, `example-deployment` will be patched - the mirrord operator will substitute topic name in `KAFKA_TOPIC_NAME` variable with a name of an ephemeral Kafka topic.

              5. Local application will see a different value of the `KAFKA_TOPIC_NAME` - it will be a name of another ephemeral Kafka topic.

              6. `MirrordKafkaClientConfig` named `example-config` living in mirrord operator's namespace will be used to manage ephemeral Kafka topics and consume/produce messages.

                  For any given topic, starting the first Kafka splitting session requires patching the target workload. Similarly, stopping the last Kafka splitting session requires another patch, that reverts the first one.

                  If the target workload takes a long time to restart, it may be desirable to keep the Kafka splits alive longer, so that the next Kafka splitting session will not have to patch the workload again.
