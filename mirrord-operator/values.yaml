  mutatingWebhooks: false
  # When set to `true`, the operator will use a custom strategy when restarting target workloads.

  ## Controls how long (in seconds) a session is allowed to live for.

  ## Controls how long (in milliseconds) a session can live when there are no pods ready to be targeted.
  # noPodTargetsSessionTimeoutMillis: 6000

  ## Default TTL (in milliseconds) for idle Kafka splits.
  ## For any given topic, starting the first Kafka splitting session requires patching the target workload.
  ## Similarly, stopping the last Kafka splitting session requires another patch, that reverts the first one.
  ## If the target workload takes a long time to restart, it may be desirable to keep the Kafka splits alive longer,
  ## so that the next Kafka splitting session will not have to patch the workload again.
  ##
  ## This value can be overridden per topic with the `spec.splitTtl` field in the `MirrordKafkaTopicsConsumer` custom resource.
  # idleKafkaSplitTtlMillis: 30000

  ##  You can adjust the format of the created kafka topic names to suit your needs. The default value is:
  ## `mirrord-tmp-{{RANDOM}}{{FALLBACK}}{{ORIGINAL_TOPIC}}`
